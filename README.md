## Introduction

This project showcases my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence using Power BI. By leveraging various data sources, implementing advanced data cleaning and transformation techniques, and designing intuitive report pages, I aim to demonstrate my ability to deliver actionable insights to stakeholders.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes multiple data sources, including:

- **Azure SQL Database**: Hosts the Orders table containing transactional data.
- **Products.csv**: Provides product information, aiding in sales analysis.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores data related to store locations.
- **Customers Data Folder**: Contains customer information necessary for segmentation analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The data cleaning and transformation process involves several steps for which I employed advanced data cleaning and transformation techniques to ensure data accuracy and consistency:

- **Power Query Editor**: Used to clean and split date and time columns, remove duplicates, and standardize column names.
- **External Data Integration**: Connects to external sources such as Azure Blob Storage to integrate disparate datasets.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Ensures data integrity by handling missing or null values appropriately.

## Data Model

The project incorporates a star schema data model to facilitate efficient data analysis and querying:

### Star Schema Design

- **Fact Table**: The central table in the star schema is the Orders table, containing transactional data such as order dates, products purchased, and sales amounts. This table serves as the fact table and is surrounded by dimension tables.

- **Dimension Tables**: Surrounding the fact table are dimension tables that provide context and additional information about various aspects of the business. These dimension tables include:
  - **Products**: Contains information about the products sold, such as product codes, descriptions, and categories.
  - **Stores**: Stores information about store locations, including store codes, names, and geographic details.
  - **Customers**: Provides details about customers, including unique identifiers, demographics, and purchasing behaviors.
  - **Date**: A date dimension table that spans the entire range of dates in the dataset, facilitating time-based analysis.

### Relationships

- **Establishing Relationships**: Relationships are established between the fact table (Orders) and dimension tables (Products, Stores, Customers, Date) based on common fields such as product codes, store codes, customer IDs, and date keys.

- **One-to-Many Relationships**: The relationships are typically one-to-many, reflecting the fact that multiple orders can be associated with a single product, store, or customer, and each order occurs on a specific date.

### Benefits of Star Schema

- **Simplicity**: The star schema design simplifies data analysis by organizing data into easily understandable dimensions and facts.
- **Efficiency**: Queries against star schema models tend to be more efficient due to the denormalized structure and optimized relationships.
- **Flexibility**: The star schema allows for flexible querying and analysis, enabling users to slice and dice data across various dimensions.
- **Scalability**: The star schema can accommodate growing data volumes and evolving analytical requirements, making it suitable for future expansion and analysis.

### Implementation

- **Implementation in Power BI**: The star schema design is implemented within Power BI by defining relationships between tables in the data model. Power BI's intuitive interface and DAX functions facilitate the creation and management of the star schema.
- **DAX Calculations**: DAX measures are utilized to perform calculations and aggregations across the fact table, leveraging the relationships established within the star schema.
- **Optimization**: The data model is optimized for performance, with careful consideration given to indexing, data types, and query optimization techniques to ensure efficient data retrieval and analysis.

By implementing a star schema data model, the project ensures a solid foundation for comprehensive and efficient data analysis within Power BI, enabling stakeholders to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Understanding Reports in Power BI

Power BI is an exceptionally versatile and customizable tool capable of creating tailored visuals and analyses to meet your professional requirements. Achieving a successful presentation hinges on understanding the objectives of your report prior to its setup, ensuring that you spotlight the relevant performance indicators aligned as per your company's priorities. Careful consideration must be given to avoid showcasing irrelevant or misleading data, as even the most visually striking report can falter if it fails to convey the right information for the right time.

Once you've identified the relevant data for your report, you can begin its construction. The choice of visuals should be guided by a multitude of factors, including including your company's preferences, industry standards and the specific goals of your analysis. It's crucial to familiarize yourself with Power BI reports to leverage its capabilities optimally. By doing so, you'll be equipped to create compelling visuals and analyses that resonate with your audience and drive informed decision-making.

## Building the Report Visuals

### Executive Summary Page

The Executive Summary page provides a high-level overview of key performance indicators and trends. It should provide all the key 

- **Navigation Elements**: Intuitive sidebar for seamless access to other report pages.
- **Visualizations**: Highlights top-level KPIs and trends using Power BI visuals.
- **Insights**: Provides actionable insights and recommendations based on data analysis.

### Product Detail Page

The Product Detail page demonstrates my proficiency in analyzing product performance:

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Identifies top-selling products and analyzes revenue and profit margins.
- **Drillthrough Functionality**: Enables detailed product analysis with just a click.
- **Filters**: Allows exploration of product data based on various criteria such as category and region.

### Customer Detail Page

The Customer Detail page highlights my skills in analyzing customer behavior and segmentation:

- **Visualizations**: Understands customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and lifetime value.
- **Segmentation**: Segments customers based on attributes such as location, age, and purchase history.
- **Insights**: Provides insights into customer segments' impact on revenue and profitability.

### Stores Map Page

The Stores Map page illustrates my ability to visualize geographical data and analyze store performance:

- **Interactive Maps**: Displays store locations and sales performance by region or country.
- **Drillthrough Functionality**: Enables detailed analysis of store performance metrics.
- **Visualizations**: Identifies trends and patterns in store data for informed decision-making.

### Drillthrough Page

The Drillthrough Page showcases my capability to provide detailed insights into specific aspects of the data:

- **Drillthrough Actions**: Navigates from summary visuals to detailed data analysis.
- **In-depth Analysis**: Examines specific metrics or dimensions based on user selection.
- **Interactivity**: Allows exploration of data in more detail to uncover actionable insights.

### Cross-Filtering and Navigation

The report enables seamless navigation and interactive data exploration:

- **Cross-Filtering**: Dynamically updates visuals based on user selection for deeper analysis.
- **Navigation Controls**: Provides intuitive controls for easy traversal between report pages.
- **User Experience**: Ensures a smooth user experience with responsive visuals and interactive elements.
